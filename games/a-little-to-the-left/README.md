### Observed result
Although the player can erase the scribbles on the book to reveal the clue with small movements, the eraser stops randomly and unpredictably with circular and long movements on the screen. It also seems to have issues near the edges of the screen.

### Impact
This bug has a minor impact because, although it does not directly affect gameplay, it can cause frustration for players if they try certain movements that were not anticipated in this feature.

### Consideration 
As the issue tends to appear while the eraser come across near the edges, it would be ideal if the developers could review this margin for long movements.
